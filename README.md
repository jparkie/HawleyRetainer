# HawleyRetainer
**An Android annotation processing and code generation library to retain complex objects which cannot be parceled nor serialized into a `Bundle` across configuration changes.**

It utilizes a retained fragment implementing the `Map` interface to provide identical operations to a `Bundle`. 

It does not behave like a Singleton class as it observes the lifecycle of its bound `Activity`, thus, it destroys itself accordingly. This characteristic is useful to prevent fields being retained in memory beyond the user-initiated destruction of an `Activity` like a Singleton while still being retained during configuration changes. 

Utilize this class as a means of simplifying the retention of certain expensive operations beyond configuration changes while obeying user-initiated lifecycle events such as concurrent, file input-output. or network operations. 

**Nonetheless, as the retained objects cannot be parceled nor serialized, they can still be claimed by the garbage collector resulting in the loss of data.**

```java
public class ExampleActivity extends Activity {
  @HawleyRetain
  Observable<Response> mNetworkResponse;
  
  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    HawleyRetainer.restoreRetainedObjectMap(this, this);
  }
  
  @Override
  public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
    super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
    HawleyRetainer.saveRetainedObjectMap(this, this);
  }
}
```

## Usage
```java
@HawleyRetain // A single annotation used to annotate any number of fields which you want to retain.

public static <T> void saveRetainedObjectMap(T target, Activity activity);

public static <T> void restoreRetainedObjectMap(T target, Activity activity);

public static <T> Map retrieveRetainerFragmentMap(T target, Activity activity);
```

The methods can be called upon any target class as long as an `Activity` can be specified along with it. The retainer will recursively traverse the inheritance graph to inject all annotated fields. Please remember that the support library variants of `Fragment` and `Activity` extend from them. As a result, the methods do not have overloads.

*Preparing for Maven Central.*

### JitPack

Add the JitPack repository to your root build file:
```groovy
repositories {
  maven {
    url "https://jitpack.io"
  }
}
```

Add the following Gradle plugin to your root build file to support annotation processing:
```groovy
dependencies {
  classpath 'com.neenbedankt.gradle.plugins:android-apt:1.4'
}
```

In your project build file apply the plugin and include the library as a dependency:
```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.neenbedankt.android-apt'

...

dependencies {
  apt 'com.github.jparkie:HawleyRetainer.compiler:1.0.1'
  compile 'com.github.jparkie:HawleyRetainer.api:1.0.1'
}
```

**If you are using other annotation processing and code generation libraries like Dagger, do not state the dependency as `provided`. Instead state the dependency as `apt` such that the code generation will run over the classes: `apt 'com.squareup.dagger:dagger-compiler:1.2.2'`.**
